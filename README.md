This Repositoriy works analog to the frontend one. 
It can be access via penguin.pengamous.org or via clicking on a penguin in the frontend.

When a pot is created, a random number determines the race of the penguin. According to this number an image is displayed from the AWS Cloud. 
Furthermore, after the pot is successfully created, its information are sent to an Azure Table Storage.
